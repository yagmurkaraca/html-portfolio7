<h1>The Best Movies According to Yagmur :d </h1>
<h2>This is a list of the movies I've watched and liked in last 3 months</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Shawshack Redemption</h3>
<p>I liked the way it represents the perseverance of the main character,Andy Duffrene, to survive from the prison he got into even though he isn't responsible for the death of his wife and her boyfriend. He gets help from the old, honourable man and uses the bugs of justice system.</p>
<h3>The Joker</h3>
<p>The movie shows the hierarchy in society very well. How society treats people with certain conditions, such as mental disorders, or how it treats people with lower financial status and the response of disadvantaged people to these mistreatments.</p>
<h3>Disobeidence</h3>
<p>It was abput a queer love story between two women, one of them was pressured by the ethical values of jewish society and the other one, the daughter of Rav, who escaped from her hometown. It makes audience to question what love is and freedom.</p>
